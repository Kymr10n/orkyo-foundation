# Fails a commit that changes user-visible behaviour without recording its documentation
# impact.
#
# The rule is not new — orkyo-documentation SPECIFICATION.md §12 ("Definition of Done for
# product changes") already requires every user-visible change to record one of: no impact,
# a documentation change, or an owned issue. Nothing enforced it, so it never happened: one
# afternoon of resource-model work left four published pages stating things the product no
# longer does.
#
# Record the decision as a commit trailer:
#
#   Docs-impact: none
#   Docs-impact: docs/user-guide/insights.md
#   Docs-impact: orkyo-documentation#12
#
# `none` is a perfectly good answer — the goal is a recorded decision, not a mandatory edit.
#
# Escape hatch: `git commit --no-verify`. Prefer `Docs-impact: none`, which leaves a trail.

  This commit touches user-visible surfaces:

$(printf '    %s\n' "${touched[@]}" | sort -u)

  but records no documentation impact.

  Add a trailer to the commit message — one of:

    Docs-impact: none
    Docs-impact: docs/user-guide/<page>.md
    Docs-impact: orkyo-documentation#<issue>

  Why: orkyo-documentation SPECIFICATION.md §12 makes this the Definition of Done for
  product changes. Documentation quotes UI strings verbatim, so a behaviour change
  falsifies pages silently unless the impact is recorded when the change is made.
